## STORYSTACK (Pack 1) — Rulebook

A collaborative card game where players take turns building a satisfying story outline. You’ll create characters, goals, plans, complications, twists, and a finale—then “skin” the outline into a full story after the game.

---

# 1) What’s in the Box

* **160 Cards** (Pack 1)

  * 10 **Story Pattern** cards
  * 150 story-building cards (Cast, Relationship, Goal & Stakes, Obstacle & Complication, Revelation & Twist, Structure, Midpoint, Crisis, Climax, Resolution)
* **1 Story Board** with **8 Beat Lanes** (each lane is a stack):

  1. Setup
  2. Inciting Incident
  3. Commitment / Crossing the Threshold
  4. Complications / Rising Action
  5. Midpoint
  6. Crisis / Dark Night
  7. Climax
  8. Resolution
* **Tag Tracker** (paper, app, or tokens) to count Beat Tags as they’re played:

  * SETUP, INCITING, GOAL, PLAN, TEAM, TRIALS, COMPLICATION, REVELATION, BETRAYAL, SACRIFICE, SHOWDOWN, AFTERMATH

---

# 2) The Goal

Work together to complete **both** objectives:

### Objective A — Fill the Beat Lanes

Create a coherent outline by adding cards to the board’s beat lanes.

### Objective B — Satisfy the Story Pattern

The chosen **Story Pattern** requires certain **Beat Tags** to appear a minimum number of times in the final outline.

You win when:

* The story reaches a valid ending (Resolution), **and**
* All Pattern tag requirements are met, **and**
* Each beat lane has at least **one** card (see “Beat Minimums”).

---

# 3) Core Concepts

### Beats

The board has 8 beats. Each beat is a **lane that can hold multiple cards** in a stack.

### Card Type vs Beat Tag

* **Card Type** controls *where* a card is allowed to be played (which beat lanes).
* **Beat Tag** controls *what it counts for* toward the Pattern requirements.

Example:

* A **Relationship** card might be legal in many beats (Type rule),
* but it might carry the **BETRAYAL** tag (Pattern rule).

### Characters and Referencing Rule (Important)

* You may only reference a character if they have been created by a **Cast** card.
* **Relationship** and many other cards require choosing existing characters.
* If you can’t legally choose required targets, you can’t play the card.

---

# 4) Setup

1. Place the **Story Board** in the center.

2. Shuffle the **Story Pattern** cards.

   * Reveal 3 at random.
   * As a group, pick 1 to play this game. Put it face-up near the board.

3. Shuffle all non-pattern cards into one **Story Deck**.

4. Deal **5 cards** to each player.

5. Choose a first player. (Oldest player, last person who read a book, etc.)

---

# 5) Beat Lane Placement Rules (Type → Beat)

When you play a card, its **Type** must be allowed in that beat lane:

* **Setup:** Cast, Relationship, Goal & Stakes, Structure
* **Inciting Incident:** Goal & Stakes, Obstacle & Complication, Revelation & Twist, Structure, Relationship
* **Commitment / Crossing the Threshold:** Goal & Stakes, Relationship, Structure, Cast
* **Complications / Rising Action:** Obstacle & Complication, Revelation & Twist, Relationship, Structure, Goal & Stakes, Cast
* **Midpoint:** Midpoint, Revelation & Twist, Structure, Goal & Stakes
* **Crisis / Dark Night:** Crisis / Dark Night, Relationship, Revelation & Twist, Goal & Stakes
* **Climax:** Climax, Obstacle & Complication, Revelation & Twist, Relationship, Structure
* **Resolution:** Resolution, Relationship, Goal & Stakes, Cast, Structure

If a card can’t be legally placed in a beat lane, you can’t play it there.

---

# 6) Beat Minimums (What “Filled” Means)

A beat lane is considered “present” if it has **at least 1 card**.

Additionally, these beats have **required card types**:

* **Midpoint lane** must contain **at least 1 Midpoint card**
* **Crisis lane** must contain **at least 1 Crisis / Dark Night card**
* **Climax lane** must contain **at least 1 Climax card**
* **Resolution lane** must contain **at least 1 Resolution card**

You can still stack extra cards in those lanes—just ensure the required type appears.

---

# 7) Turn Structure

On your turn:

### Step 1 — Play 1 Card

Choose **one** card from your hand and play it into a legal beat lane.

When you play a card:

* Place it in the chosen beat lane stack.
* Immediately apply any choices on the card (choose characters, define objects, set costs, etc.).
* Add its **Beat Tag** to the Tag Tracker (increase the count for that tag by 1), if it has one.

### Step 2 — Draw Back Up

Draw 1 card from the Story Deck.

Your hand returns to 5 cards (unless the deck is empty).

---

# 8) Shared Story State (Keeping Things Consistent)

You’ll maintain a simple shared state as the outline grows. A notebook works great.

Track:

* **Characters** (A, B, C…) and their notes (wants, needs, wounds, lies, etc.)
* **Objects / Locations / Factions / Threats** as they appear
* **Active Threads** (Main Thread A, optional Thread B from Structure cards)
* **Tag Counts** toward the Pattern card

If a new card contradicts an old one, resolve it immediately using “Retcon Rule.”

---

# 9) The Retcon Rule (When Cards Conflict)

If a played card contradicts something already established:

The active player chooses one:

1. **Reframe:** Interpret both as true by adding an explanation (“It seemed like X, but actually Y.”)
2. **Override:** The new card replaces the old detail.
3. **Branch:** Use a Structure card effect in fiction (“Parallel Plots,” “Flashback Reframe,” “Secret Connection”) to justify the shift.

You should keep the outline moving. Don’t stall on perfect logic.

---

# 10) Thread Rules (Subplots)

Subplots aren’t separate lanes—subplots are created using **Structure** cards.

### Creating Thread B

* Playing **PARALLEL PLOTS** creates a second active thread: **Thread B**.
* Once Thread B exists, players may interpret later cards as supporting either thread during the “Skinning” phase.

### Keeping Subplots Useful

Thread B should either:

* produce a clue (REVELATION),
* escalate pressure (COMPLICATION/TRIALS),
* trigger betrayal (BETRAYAL),
* or pay off emotionally (AFTERMATH).

---

# 11) Pattern Requirements (How You Actually Win)

Your chosen Story Pattern lists minimum counts for certain **Beat Tags**.

Example (simplified):

* TRIALS(≥2) means you must have played at least 2 cards tagged TRIALS anywhere on the board.

Tags can appear in any beat lane—placement is governed by **Type**, not by Tag.

---

# 12) Ending the Game

The game ends when a player successfully plays a **Resolution** card **and** all of the following are true:

1. Every beat lane has at least **one** card.
2. Midpoint/Crisis/Climax/Resolution lanes contain their required type at least once.
3. The Pattern card’s Beat Tag requirements are satisfied.

If a Resolution card is played but requirements aren’t met:

* The Resolution stays in play (it happened “early”).
* Continue playing until requirements are met (you can add more after the ending as epilogue context).

---

# 13) If You Get Stuck (No Legal Plays)

If you cannot legally play any card from your hand:

1. Reveal the top card of the Story Deck.
2. If you can play it, you must play it immediately.
3. If you still can’t play, discard your hand and draw 5 new cards.
4. If the deck is empty, the table may:

   * move one card to a different legal beat lane (once per game), or
   * declare the story a “Broken Outline” and score it anyway (see next section).

---

# 14) Optional Scoring (If You Want a Winner)

If you want competitive play:

Each player scores:

* **+1** per card they played that matches a required Pattern tag (up to the requirement cap)
* **+2** if they played the **first** Midpoint / Crisis / Climax / Resolution card
* **+1** for each Relationship card they played that pays off in Resolution (group decides)

Highest score wins. Ties share victory.

---

# 15) The Skinning Phase (After the Game)

Now turn the outline into a story pitch.

As a group:

1. Give real names to Characters A, B, C…
2. Decide setting details for Locations and Factions
3. Write 1–2 sentences per card, in beat order, to create the final synopsis

You now have a complete plot outline built by play.

---

## Quick Start Summary (1 minute)

* Pick a Pattern.
* Deal 5 cards.
* Each turn: play 1 legal card → update shared state → count its tag → draw 1.
* Keep going until the story has Midpoint, Crisis, Climax, and Resolution—and the Pattern tag requirements are met.

If you want, I can also format this as a **single printable one-page rules sheet** and a **separate reference card** that lists beat lanes + allowed types + tag pool.
